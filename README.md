## Dashboard
For the Reporting Dashboard, the first chart is a bar chart of the top 5 browsers to understand which browsers the users are using. A bar chart was used as it is the clearest way to compare different categories side-by-side. By choosing only 5 browsers, it's easier to understand what the majority of users are visiting on, so that future improvements can be made to performance on those browsers. Second, a line chart of page load times to spot slowdowns over time. A line chart was chosen as it shows trends which are easy to spot such as spikes in load time. This makes it easier to understand whether certain changes to the site resulted in worse performance and slower load times to the site. Third, a small grid of the last 10 user events. A table grid was chosen as it gives exact details on what the user id was and what event was performed at a given timestamp.  The last 10 events were chosen as to better see how changes affect certain events the list can be expanded if needed. Keeping it shorter also makes it more readable and easy to understand without having too much information to go through.

## Report
- Guiding Question: My report is designed to answer the question: "Which pages on my site are causing the most JavaScript errors, and what are those errors?" I selected this question because it directly addresses issues that negatively impact user experience and provides developers with a clear starting point for debugging and improving the application.
- Chart: Errors per Page (Bar Chart)
  - What it shows: A bar chart summarizing the total number of errors that have occurred on each page of the website.
  - Why I chose it: This visualization immediately answers the first half of my guiding question by highlighting the most problematic pages. A bar chart is the most effective choice for comparing the error counts across different, distinct categories (pages), making it easy to prioritize which page to fix first.
-  Grid: Error Log Details
  - What it shows: A detailed, filterable grid of every single error event, including the error message, the source file where the error occurred, the specific line number, and the timestamp.
  - Why I chose it: While the chart shows where the problems are, the grid shows what the problems are. It provides the specific, raw data a developer needs to debug the issues identified by the chart. A grid is the best format for this detailed, tabular data, allowing for easy reading and sorting.
- Written Discussion:
  - The written text on the page serves to synthesize the information from both the chart and the grid, directly answering the guiding question. It guides the user's interpretation of the data, pointing out the most error-prone pages and explaining how the grid can be used to investigate further, creating a complete and actionable report. Of course, it currently only states that "No JavaScript error data has been collected yet," but this monitoring and analytics has been successfully set up to monitor for errors, which is important in a production environment.
